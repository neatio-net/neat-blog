Neatio is more than what Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned 13 years ago, “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash which would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution”.

Neatio is a young, but bold, project meant to challenge the current solution for payments.

With that in mind, Neatio is build to be an advanced payment solution, a blazing fast blockchain, that has a 1,5 sec tx finality time and can process over one million transactions per second. It is also EVM compatible, meaning that it can support smart contracts.

Neatio is a proof-of-stake blockchain designed for speed and efficiency. The network prioritizes speed, usability, and low fees to make payments and transfers fast, affordable, and secure. The network’s economy runs on NEAT, our native coin that can be gained by proof of stake, through delegation or by running a full validator node.

Total supply is fixed, capped at 50 million and set to be reached in approximately 15 years, minting will end in 2037 with a daily inflation of 8235 NEAT.
